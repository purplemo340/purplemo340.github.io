		  <li>Continuous Range Detection: The system is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor that 
			  operates constantly to measure distances within its field of view.</li>
		  <li>Joystick Control: The scan angle of the ultrasonic sensor is manipulated by a joystick 
			  module. This joystick control mechanism enables
			  users to finely adjust the scanning direction within the specified angular range.</li>
		  <li>Proximity Alert: Ensuring safety and awareness, the system employs a buzzer that triggers
			  warning tones whenever it detects an object positioned within a proximity of less than 
			  10 cm. This alert system helps prevent collisions and provides real-time feedback to the user.</li>
		  <li>Distance Visualization: Simultaneously, a seven-segment display 
			  serves as a visual indicator of an obstacle's proximity. The display portrays three distinct
			  levels:
		  <ul>
			<li>Level 0: Represents objects within the immediate 10 cm range.</li>
			<li>Level 1: Indicates objects within the 11-20 cm range.</li>
			<li>Level 2: Signifies objects located beyond a distance greater than 20 cm.</li>
	  	  </ul>
		  </li>
<li>Device Status LEDs: The system incorporates two LEDs, one green and one red, to convey its operational
	status. During the scanning operation, the green LED is illuminated, while the red LED is activated when 
	the system is not actively scanning. These LEDs offer a quick visual indication of the device's current state.</li>
