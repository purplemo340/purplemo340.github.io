    <ul>
      <li>Beaglebone Black</li>
      <li>Passive Buzzer</li>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>In a group of three, we created a device would track wheter a user was sleeping. To do this the user's
    heartrate was tracked to determine if it reached below a certain threshold.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Collection: The raspberry pi is set up as a publisher and sends data to the broker continuously. </li>
      <li>Network Communication: Used server and client configuratons to create a publisher, subscriber, and broker 
	      network. A Beaglebone black was used to publish or send heartrates to the broker. The broker collected the data
      	      as well as waited for commands from the subscribers.</li>
      <li>Interface Design: Using Microsoft Visual Studio, we created a interface that subscribers would be able to use to 
	      send commands to the broker. The following is what the buttons did:
	      <ul>
		      <li>Start API: Connects the subscriber to the broker of the system. The heartrate are then
		      plotted on the chart.</li>
		      <li>Stop API: Disconnects the subscriber from the broker and stops plotting the heartrate
		      on the chart. </li>
		      <li>Stay Awake: This function will cause the buzzer to sound off if the heartrate reaches below
		      a certain threshold. The buzzer will turn off when the heartrate reaches above the threshold. </li>
		      <li>Wake Up:This function was used to trigger the alarm regardless of what the heartrate is. </li>
		      <li>Sleep: When this command is sent the stay awake function turns off and the buzzer 
		      will not turn on regardless of the heartrate. </li>
	      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Intergroup Communication: Configured the system to communicate with another group's broker. </li>
    </ul>
