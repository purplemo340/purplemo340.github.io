		<h2>Goal</h2>
		<p>For this project the goal was to capture images that would be able to accurately show the user
		the number that is displayed on a piece of paper. The system could do the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Image Capturing: The system integrated a Raspberry Pi camera that was used to capture
			images on a piece of paper. </li>
			<li>Image Analysis: Using python, machine learning is used to pinpoint the most important parts 
			of the images to help determine what number is written in the image.</li>
			<li>Data Vizualization: After determining what the number in the image is, the number is 
			displayed on the Raspberry Pi Sensehat. </li>
		</ul>
