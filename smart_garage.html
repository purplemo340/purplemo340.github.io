      <h1>Smart Parking Garage</h1>
      <p>One of the requirements for my degree program was completing a senior design project that 
      encompasses everything that I learned in classes throughout the years. For two semesters, I worked in a group of 
      four individuals where we created a system that could be implemented into present parking garages. The system we 
      created did the following: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Counted the amount of vehicles in the garage.</li>
        <li>Authenticated each driver that entered the garage.</li>
        <li>Predicted the amount of cars that would be in the garage at certain points of the day. </li>
      </ul>
	<img src="data.jpg" alt="Image of the smart parking garage system" align="left"/> <p class="image">The image on the left is
		the module that was created for our system. The module included two PIR sensors, two cameras, and a RFID
		reader.
	    <ul class="image_p">
		    <li>Cameras: Used to capture the front and bach of the vehicle to store for the proper authorities.
		    The images were sent to an email with the date and time that the car entered or exited the garage.</li>
		    <li>PIR Sensors: Used to determine if the vehicle entered or exited the garage.</li>
		    <li>RFID Reader: Each driver would have a card that would authenticate each user that comes
		    into the garage.</li>
	    </ul></p>
