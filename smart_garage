      <h1>Smart Parking Garage</h1>
      <h2>One of the requirements for my degree program was completing a senior design project that 
      encompasses everything that I learned in classes throughout the years. For two semesters I worked in a group of 
      four individuals where we created a system that could be implemented into present parking garages that would do the
      following: </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Counted the amount of vehicles in the garage.</li>
        <li>Authenticated each driver that entered the garage.</li>
        <li>Predicted the amount of cars that would be in the garage at certain points of the day. </li>
      </ul>
