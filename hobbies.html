        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>I have always loved reading. During my free time, I like
            to read sci-fi and fantasy books. A personal project that 
            I completed shows a database of some of the books that I 
            have read. I thought it would be interesting to combine
            my two interests: Coding and Reading.

        <h2>Listening to Music</h2>
        <p>I love music. I especially enjoy hearing new elements in 
            a song that I have listened to millions of times.

        <h2>Crocheting</h2>
        <p>When I was in elementary school I taught myself how 
            to crochet through YouTube tutorials. It is amazing how 
            easily one can learn something from resources online.
