      <h1>My Background/h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the United States Virgin Islands. I graduated from the Charlotte Amalie
      High School in the top ten of the class. When I began high school I was introduced to the world of
        programming and I knew that I wanted to study in a major that involved coding to an extent. 
        I decided to move to Georgia to further my education and majored in Computer Engineering. 
        During my time in high school I took AP classe and was a dual enrollment student which enabled 
        me to begin my college career as accelerated student and to finish my degree earlier than expected.
      </p>

        <p>My whole life, my mom has instilled in me the importance of education. therefore I consider
        gaining my degree one of my greatest achievements. As I am looking for opportunities in the early 
        career field, I have continued to enhance my skills by improving my Python and SQL skills. I
        intend to continue my eduacation by getting a Masters Degree in Machine Learning. </p>
